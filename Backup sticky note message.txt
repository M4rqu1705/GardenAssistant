To do:
	(Mobile CSP) Program Garden Assistant
		(Daniela)Start screen
			-Background to display while program loads
			-The main menu will load with this background
		(Daniela)Generic Button Layout
			-Text will be written on the Silkscreen font over this layout so everyting looks homogenous, pixelated and cute
		(Daniela) Night Sky
			-Good job!! It is looking great!!
		(Daniela) Moon phases
			-I susggest you can do them separately, without a background, to add randomness to each shar
		(Daniela) Star and it's blinking phases
			-If you do one star with different "stages" to it's blinking light, the program can randomize the rate at which it blinks
				With a GIF it would be constant and repetitive
		(Daniela)Grid Square 
			-When the person uses the gnome, pinwheel, etc. to plan their garden, it has to be on a grid. This grid should have 4 tipes of "floor"
				1. Blank spaces (the garden will not always have ALL the spaces filled, so there must be some blank squares where nothing can be planted on)
				2. Grass (green, normal grass where normal plants can be put on)
				3. Stone pathway (plants will not go on sidewalks because people can trip even on potted plants)
				4. Normal cement (if the person has some sort of gazebo, this represents zones where only potted plants can be put on)
			-Just so you know, these squares will be laid out on side by side, one on top or bottom of the other, to make a grid. You should make the sidewalk and the grass continuous (as in, where one ends, the other begins)
